# Emotion Recogition Sample

A simple UWP application that uses a pretrained machine learning model called FERPlus to recognize the predominant emotion in an image taken directly from the camera. 

This sample demonstrates the use of generic Windows.AI.MachineLearning.Preview API to load a model, bind an input image and an output tensor, and evaluate a binding.
